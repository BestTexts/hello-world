# hello-world
Hello GitHub community! This is how every project begins. With a simple, silly name... 
I always considered myself a humanist - not exactly cut out for coding, right? Most of my professional life was spent teaching English.
And I wasn’t wrong about being a humanist. But still, something felt missing. The impact of my work wasn’t always clear.

Then I gave coding a try, and I realized...
It’s not so different from writing in Polish, English, or any other language. You’re simply learning a new language to express ideas and tell stories.
And you can see those stories come to life, not just imagine them.
I'm here to make other people's stories appear on screen.
